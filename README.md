# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Evan Henry â€“ WordPress Developer & Laravel Learner

I'm a web developer who focuses on building clean, maintainable websites and custom functionality. I work primarily with WordPress and WooCommerce, building advanced Gutenberg blocks using ACF Composer, Sage, Tailwind CSS, and Webpack.

Lately, Iâ€™ve been sharpening my skills in OOP/MVC architecture through WordPress plugin development, diving into Laravel with Laracasts, and tinkering with AI-powered tooling to stay ahead of the curve.

- Increasing focus on clean OOP and MVC plugin architecture  
- Actively learning Laravel to move beyond WordPress and grow as a full-stack developer

- Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my sons, fishing, playing acoustic guitar, and the occasional game of Magic.
